A port of the now deprecated [dagrejs/graphlib](https://github.com/dagrejs/graphlib) library to modern TypeScript with JSDoc documentation from [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/graphlib/index.d.ts).

Migrating from JS objects to Maps means that IDs/keys are now evaluated with strict equality and not converted to strings internally as before.
